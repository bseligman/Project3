# Project3

# since honesty is the best policy, here's the truth:
# i (again) completely misinterpreted the project, which made me think it was bigger then it was
# thereforth I attempted it, thought I was dumb because everyone was finishing it so quickly, and thought I was stupid because its such a big projcet and I was slow
# nope turns out its not a matrix-parser to calculate for the best price per segment
